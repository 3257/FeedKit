/**
    The channel's item. A channel may contain any number of `<item>`s. An item may represent a "story" -- much like a story in
    a newspaper or magazine;  if so its description is a synopsis of the story, and the link points to the full story.
    An item may also be complete in itself, if so, the description contains the text (entity-encoded HTML is allowed;
    see examples: http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/encodingDescriptions.html), and the link and title may be omitted.
    All elements of an item are optional, however at least one of title or description must be present.
